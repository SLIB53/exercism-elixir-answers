# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir isogram_test.exs
```
